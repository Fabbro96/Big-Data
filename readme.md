## Project of the course "Big Data" at the University of Verona: wikipedia inverted index
The project consists in the creation of an inverted index of the wikipedia dump.
It was done in three steps:
1. Parsing of the wikipedia dump (an XML file) using the etree library
2. Manipulation of the csv files to create the inverted index and other files needed for the next step
3. Creating the graphs
